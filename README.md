# 5bubgame
This is a simple iOS game (fit both iPhone and iPad) that you can move bubble around the 10 by 10 game board and whenever at least 5 same color bubbles are connected, they will be destroyed

After each move, if no bubble is destroyed, 3 new bubbles will be generated on random location

Some special bubbles are added in advanced mode to help you survive longer

The idea is from the game that I sam my mother playing when I was a child. Now I made it, and added the advanced mode to make it more interesting

Sorry for the poor UI since for now I don't have enough time nor resources to make it better

Good news! It is avaliable on iTunes now! The name is 5 Blowup!

# 5bubgame
This is a simple iOS that you can move bubble around the 10 by 10 game board and whenever at least
5 same color bubbles are connected, they will be destroyed

After each move, if no bubble is destroyed, 3 new bubbles will be generated on random location

Some special bubbles are added in advanced mode to make the game more interesting
